                    <p>On Earth -12, the God of War Ares managed to create a helmet that amplified his powers a hundredfold. After learning of this, Batman and Wonder Woman vowed to slay the god and destroy his helmet.

                        The pair got embroiled in a 2-year-long war against Ares' forces before finally confronting the deity in combat, during which Wonder Woman was seemingly killed. Heartbroken over losing the woman he loved, Batman swore Ares would pay then used the God of War's helmet to kill him, although its power corrupted Batman's mind in the process. Afterward, Batman found that Wonder Woman was still alive and had just been stunned by Ares, but when she tried to remove the helmet from him, Batman chose to kill her rather than give up its power.
                        
                        The empowered Batman then dropped his moral code and went on a killing spree; murdering various criminals and later heroes who tried to stop him. Eventually, Batman's rampage took him to Olympus as Earth -12 began to collapse, and was then given an opportunity by The Batman Who Laughs to take part in "the greatest war the cosmos has ever seen"; a war of survival. Wanting to prove that his new philosophy is the correct one and having nothing left to lose, Batman took up his counterpart's offer and joined the Dark Knights as The Merciless.</p>
